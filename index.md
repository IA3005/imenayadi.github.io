## About me
I am a researcher in applied mathematics, working at the intersection of **robust statistics,
Riemannian geometry and statistical learning**, with applications in **signal processing**,
in particular **electroencephalography (EEG)** and brain–computer interfaces.

My research focuses on developing **robust statistical and geometric methods for learning
from covariance matrices**, motivated by real-world noisy and heterogeneous data.

## Research interests
- Robust statistics
- Riemannian geometry
- Statistical learning on manifolds
- Covariance matrix modeling
- Signal processing (EEG, hyperspectral imaging)
