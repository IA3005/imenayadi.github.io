## Research overview
My research lies in **applied mathematics**, combining **statistics**, **Riemannian geometry**
and **machine learning** to address challenges arising in signal processing and data analysis.

A central theme of my work is the development of **robust learning methods for structured data**,
with a particular emphasis on **covariance matrices**, which naturally live on the manifold of
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices.

## PhD research
**Robust Geometrical Learning for Electroencephalography**  
PhD, Université Paris-Saclay, 2025

My doctoral work addressed the limitations of Gaussian-based models for covariance matrices
in noisy and non-Gaussian settings, such as EEG signals.

Main contributions include:
- Statistical analysis of **Elliptical Wishart and Inverse Elliptical Wishart distributions**
- Derivation of expectations, variances and **Kronecker moments of arbitrary order**
- Development of an **information-geometric framework** for these distributions
- Maximum likelihood estimation on the SPD manifold
- Robust classification and clustering methods for covariance matrices

## Applications
- Electroencephalography (EEG) and brain–computer interfaces
- Hyperspectral image analysis
- Robust signal classification and clustering

## Perspectives
My current interests include:
- Robust learning on structured manifolds
- Information geometry for statistical inference
- Connections between Riemannian optimization and modern machine learning
