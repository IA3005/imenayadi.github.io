## Teaching interests
I am interested in teaching courses related to **applied mathematics and data analysis**,
including:

- Probability and statistics
- Statistical signal processing
- Machine learning
- Optimization and numerical methods
- Geometry for data science

## Pedagogical approach
I favor a teaching approach combining:
- Mathematical foundations
- Practical examples and applications
- Numerical experiments (Python, MATLAB)
- Real-world datasets (e.g., EEG signals)
